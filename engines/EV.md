## 🚗 Types of Electric Vehicles

* **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**: Fully electric, powered solely by rechargeable batteries.
* **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**: Combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor; can be charged via an external source.
* **Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)**: Use both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor; cannot be plugged in.
* **Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs)**: Generate electricity through hydrogen fuel cells, emitting only water vapor.

## 🌱 Environmental Benefits

* **Zero Tailpipe Emissions**: BEVs produce no direct emissions, reducing air pollutants.
* **Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: EVs emit fewer greenhouse gases over their lifetime compared to conventional vehicles.
* **Improved Air Quality**: Reduced emissions contribute to better air quality, especially in urban areas.
* **Energy Efficiency**: EVs convert over 60% of electrical energy into motion, compared to about 20% for gasoline vehicles.
