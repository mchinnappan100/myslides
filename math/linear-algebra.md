## 📐 Fundamental Concepts

* **Scalars**: Single numbers representing magnitude.

* **Vectors**: Ordered lists of numbers representing direction and magnitude. 

* **Matrices**: Rectangular arrays of numbers used to represent linear transformations.

* **Linear Transformations**: Functions that map vectors to other vectors in a linear manner.

## 🔄 Matrix Operations

* **Addition and Subtraction**: Combining matrices of the same dimensions.

* **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying each element by a scalar.

* **Matrix Multiplication**: Combining matrices to represent successive linear transformations.

* **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal.

* **Determinant**: A scalar value that can indicate the invertibility of a matrix.

## 🧠 Key Theorems and Concepts

* **Rank–Nullity Theorem**: Relates the dimensions of a vector space to the rank and nullity of a linear transformation.  

* **Linear Independence**: A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector can be written as a combination of the others. 

* **Span**: The set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors. 

* **Basis and Dimension**: A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a space; the number of vectors in the basis defines the space's dimension.
