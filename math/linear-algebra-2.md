## ➕📐 Introduction to Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the **mathematics of vectors and matrices**.
It forms the foundation of modern computing, graphics, physics, and machine learning.

## 🔢 What Is Linear Algebra?

It focuses on **linear equations**, **vector spaces**, and **linear transformations**.

Key structures:

* Vectors
* Matrices
* Systems of linear equations

---

## 🔄 Vectors

A **vector** is an ordered list of numbers (magnitude + direction).

Example:
**v = \[2, 3]**

Operations:

* Addition: `[2, 3] + [1, 1] = [3, 4]`
* Scalar multiplication: `2 × [2, 3] = [4, 6]`

---

## 🧮 Matrices

A **matrix** is a 2D array of numbers.

Example:

```
A = | 1  2 |
    | 3  4 |
```

Used to represent:

* Linear transformations
* Systems of equations

---

## ➗ Solving Linear Systems

System of equations:

```
2x + 3y = 5  
4x - y  = 1
```

Can be written as:
**A × x = b**
Where:

* **A** is the coefficient matrix
* **x** is the variable vector
* **b** is the result vector

---

## 📏 Dot Product

The **dot product** of vectors `a` and `b`:
`a · b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + ... + aₙbₙ`

Used for:

* Measuring angles between vectors
* Determining orthogonality
* Calculating projections

---

## 🔁 Matrix Multiplication

To multiply matrices A and B:

* Take the **dot product** of rows of A with columns of B
* Resulting matrix combines these into a new structure

✅ Not commutative: `A × B ≠ B × A`

---

## 🧠 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

An **eigenvector** of a matrix doesn’t change direction under transformation.

**A × v = λ × v**

* `v` = eigenvector
* `λ` = eigenvalue

Used in:

* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* Vibration analysis
* Quantum mechanics

## 📊 Applications of Linear Algebra

* 🎮 **Computer graphics** (rotations, scaling)
* 🧠 **Machine learning** (model training, PCA)
* 🌐 **Search engines** (PageRank)
* 🚀 **Physics** (quantum states, mechanics)

---

## 🧮 Summary

Linear algebra helps us:

* Represent data as **vectors and matrices**
* Transform and manipulate data efficiently
* Solve real-world problems across science and tech

## “Math is the language of the universe” 🌌

Linear algebra is the **grammar** that powers AI, simulations, and modern computation.
