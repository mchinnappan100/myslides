## What Are AI Agents?

* **AI Agents** are autonomous software entities that perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform actions to achieve specific objectives.
* They can operate independently or collaborate with humans and other agents.
* Examples include chatbots, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.

## Core Components of AI Agents

* **Perception**: Gathering data from the environment through sensors or inputs.
* **Knowledge Base**: Storing information and learned experiences.
* **Reasoning Engine**: Making decisions based on goals and available data.
* **Action Module**: Executing tasks to influence the environment.
* **Learning Mechanism**: Adapting behavior based on new information.

## Types of AI Agents

* **Reactive Agents**: Respond to stimuli without internal representation.
* **Deliberative Agents**: Use internal models to plan actions.
* **Hybrid Agents**: Combine reactive and deliberative approaches.
* **Collaborative Agents**: Work with other agents or humans to achieve goals.
