# 🔧 Internal Combustion Engines  
## Powering the Modern World

---

## 🚗 What is an Internal Combustion Engine?

- A heat engine where combustion of fuel occurs inside the engine
- Converts chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy
- Commonly used in:
  - Automobiles
  - Motorcycles
  - Small aircraft
  - Lawn equipment

---

## 🔥 Basic Principle

> **Combustion inside the cylinder drives a piston, converting thermal energy into motion.**

**Key Concepts:**
- Fuel + Air mixture
- Spark ignition or compression ignition
- Reciprocating motion → Rotational motion (via crankshaft)

---

## 🛠️ Main Components

- **Cylinder**  
- **Piston**  
- **Spark Plug** (in gasoline engines)  
- **Crankshaft**  
- **Camshaft**  
- **Fuel Injector/Carburetor**  
- **Valves (Intake & Exhaust)**

---

## ⚙️ Four-Stroke Cycle

1. **Intake**  
   Air-fuel mixture enters the cylinder

2. **Compression**  
   Mixture is compressed by piston

3. **Power (Combustion)**  
   Spark ignites the mixture; explosion pushes piston down

4. **Exhaust**  
   Burnt gases expelled

## ⛽ Types of Internal Combustion Engines

- **Spark Ignition (SI) Engine**  
  - Uses a spark plug (e.g., gasoline engines)

- **Compression Ignition (CI) Engine**  
  - Fuel ignites due to compression heat (e.g., diesel engines)

- **2-Stroke Engine**  
  - Combines strokes for simplicity, but less efficient

- **4-Stroke Engine**  
  - Most common in cars and motorcycles

---

## 🧪 Fuel Types

- Gasoline (Petrol)  
- Diesel  
- Natural Gas  
- Ethanol Blends  
- Synthetic Fuels

> Emissions and fuel efficiency depend on fuel type and engine design.
