**Theory & Practice of Cooling, Heating, and Humidity Control**

---

## 🌡 What is Air Conditioning?
- Process of **controlling temperature, humidity, and air quality** in an enclosed space  
- Provides **thermal comfort** and **healthy indoor environment**  
- Used in homes, offices, industrial setups, and vehicles  

---

## 🔧 Core Functions
1. **Cooling** – Lowering air temperature  
2. **Heating** – Increasing air temperature (in some systems)  
3. **Humidity Control** – Dehumidifying or humidifying as needed  
4. **Air Filtration** – Removing dust, pollen, and pollutants

## ⚙️ Basic Components
- **Compressor:** Circulates refrigerant and increases pressure  
- **Condenser:** Releases heat from refrigerant to the outside  
- **Expansion Valve:** Reduces pressure of refrigerant before it enters evaporator  
- **Evaporator:** Absorbs heat from indoor air  

---

## ❄️ Refrigeration Cycle (Theory)
1. **Evaporation:** Refrigerant absorbs heat from indoor air → cools the space  
2. **Compression:** Refrigerant gas is compressed → raises temperature & pressure  
3. **Condensation:** Refrigerant releases heat to outside air → turns back to liquid  
4. **Expansion:** Pressure drops → ready for next cycle

## 🌬 Air Distribution & Ventilation
- **Ducts and fans** circulate conditioned air  
- **Vents and diffusers** deliver air to rooms  
- Ensures **uniform temperature** and **good indoor air quality**  

---

## 🏠 Practical Considerations
- Proper **insulation** reduces load  
- **Regular maintenance**: Clean filters, coils, and ducts  
- Correct **sizing of AC units** for room/area  
- Avoid overcooling to save energy  

---

## 💡 Key Principles to Remember
- Heat flows from **hot to cold**  
- Humidity affects **thermal comfort**  
- AC systems combine **thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer**  
- Energy efficiency is critical in design and operation  

---

## ✅ Summary
- Air conditioning = Temperature + Humidity + Air Quality control  
- Operates on **refrigeration cycle**  
- Requires **proper design, installation, and maintenance** for efficiency  
- Essential for **comfort, productivity, and equipment protection**
