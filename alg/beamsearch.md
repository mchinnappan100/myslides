Beam Search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes in a limited set. It's widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition to generate sequences with higher overall probabilities compared to greedy approaches.

## üß† How Beam Search Works

1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial state (e.g., a start token).
2. **Expansion**: Generate all possible successors of the current states.
3. **Scoring**: Assign a score (often a probability) to each successor.
4. **Pruning**: Select the top *k* successors based on their scores; *k* is the beam width.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the expansion, scoring, and pruning steps until a termination condition is met (e.g., reaching an end token or maximum sequence length). 

This process balances exploration and computational efficiency by maintaining only the most promising candidates at each step.&#x20;

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters

* **Beam Width (*k*)**: Determines the number of candidate sequences retained at each step. A larger *k* allows for a broader search but increases computational cost.
* **Length Penalty**: Adjusts the scores of sequences based on their lengths to prevent the algorithm from favoring shorter sequences.

## üìà Advantages

* **Improved Accuracy**: By considering multiple hypotheses, Beam Search often yields better results than greedy search.
* **Flexibility**: Applicable to various sequence generation tasks in NLP and beyond.
* **Efficiency**: Offers a good trade-off between performance and computational resources.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **Not Guaranteed to Find Optimal Solution**: Beam Search is not exhaustive; it may miss the best sequence if it's not among the top *k* candidates at any step.
* **Sensitivity to Beam Width**: Choosing an inappropriate beam width can lead to suboptimal results or increased computational load.
* **Bias Towards Shorter Sequences**: Without proper length normalization, the algorithm may prefer shorter sequences.

## üß™ Example: Text Generation

Consider generating a sentence with a beam width of 3:

1. **Start**: Begin with the start token.
2. **First Expansion**: Generate possible first words, e.g., "The", "A", "An".
3. **Prune**: Keep the top 3 based on their probabilities.
4. **Second Expansion**: For each of the 3 sequences, generate possible next words.
5. **Prune**: From all new sequences, retain the top 3.
6. **Repeat**: Continue this process until end tokens are generated. 

This method ensures that the most promising sequences are explored without exhaustively considering all possibilities.
