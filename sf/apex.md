## üîë Key Features of Apex

* **Object-Oriented**: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enabling modular and reusable code.  

* **Strongly Typed**: Variables must be declared with a specific data type, reducing errors during compilation.  

* **Integrated with Salesforce**: Seamlessly interacts with Salesforce data using SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) and DML operations.  

* **Built-in Testing**: Provides support for unit test creation and execution, ensuring code reliability.  

* **Automatic Upgrades**: Apex code is automatically upgraded with Salesforce releases, minimizing maintenance efforts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Use Cases

* **Custom Business Logic**: Implement complex validation rules and automation beyond declarative tools.

* **Triggers**: Execute code in response to database events like insertions, updates, or deletions.  
* **Web Services**: Expose custom APIs or integrate with external systems using REST or SOAP. )

* **Batch Processing**: Handle large data volumes asynchronously for tasks like data cleansing or complex calculations.

## üß™ Apex Syntax Example

```apex
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void sayHello() {
        System.debug('Hello, World!');
    }
}
```



This simple class defines a method `sayHello` that outputs "Hello, World!" to the debug log. ([simplifiedforce.com][6])
