 

## üöÄ Introduction to Salesforce Platform Events

**Salesforce Platform Events** enable real-time, event-driven communication within Salesforce and between external systems. They follow a publish-subscribe model, allowing different parts of your application to react to events as they occur.

## üîÑ Key Concepts

* **Event**: A significant change in state, such as the creation of a new record. 

* **Event Message**: The data payload associated with an event. 

* **Event Producer**: The source that publishes events.

* **Event Consumer**: The subscriber that processes events. 

* **Event Bus**: The channel through which events are transmitted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Defining and Publishing Platform Events

* **Defining Events**: Platform Events are defined similarly to custom objects, with fields representing the data to be transmitted.  

* **Publishing Methods**:

  * **Declaratively**: Using Flows or Process Builder.
  * **Programmatically**: Using Apex code.
  * **Externally**: Via Salesforce APIs.

## üì¨ Subscribing to Platform Events

* **Subscription Methods**:

  * **Declaratively**: Using Flows.
  * **Programmatically**: Using Apex triggers or Lightning components.
  * **Externally**: Via CometD protocol or other APIs.  

* **Considerations**:

  * Platform Event triggers run asynchronously.
  * They execute under the Automated Process system user.
  * Debug logs for these triggers require specific setup.

## üí° Use Cases

* **Real-Time Notifications**: Inform users or systems immediately when specific events occur.

* **System Integration**: Facilitate communication between Salesforce and external systems.
