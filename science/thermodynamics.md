## 🔥 Introduction to Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and the forms of energy transformation.
It plays a central role in engineering, chemistry, and physics.

## 🌡️ What is Thermodynamics?

* **Thermo** → Heat
* **Dynamics** → Motion

Thermodynamics studies how thermal energy is converted to other forms of energy and how it affects matter.

---

## 🧪 Key Concepts

* **System**: The part of the universe being studied (e.g., gas in a cylinder)
* **Surroundings**: Everything else outside the system
* **Boundary**: The interface between the system and its surroundings
* **State**: Defined by properties like pressure, volume, temperature

## ⚖️ The Four Laws of Thermodynamics

---

### 🧵 Zeroth Law

> If A = B and B = C in thermal equilibrium, then A = C.

🔁 Enables the definition of **temperature**.

---

### ♨️ First Law – Law of Energy Conservation

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

ΔU = Q - W
Where:

* ΔU → Change in internal energy
* Q → Heat added to the system
* W → Work done by the system

---

### 🌬️ Second Law – Entropy Rules

> The entropy of an isolated system never decreases.

💡 Heat flows naturally from **hot to cold**, not the other way around.
♻️ Implies the **irreversibility** of natural processes.

---

### 🧊 Third Law – Absolute Zero

> As temperature approaches **absolute zero**, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero.

🌡️ 0 Kelvin = -273.15°C
💤 Perfect order, no energy exchange

## 📚 Thermodynamic Processes

* **Isothermal** (ΔT = 0)
* **Adiabatic** (Q = 0)
* **Isobaric** (ΔP = 0)
* **Isochoric** (ΔV = 0)

---

## ⚙️ Applications

✅ Internal combustion engines
✅ Refrigerators and air conditioners
✅ Power plants and turbines
✅ Chemical reactions and equilibrium

---

## 😵 Common Challenges

* Understanding entropy
* Keeping sign conventions straight
* Applying laws to real-world systems
* Visualizing abstract energy flows

---

## 🧠 Summary

Thermodynamics helps us understand:

✅ How energy moves
✅ Why processes happen
✅ What limits machines face
✅ The fate of systems over time
