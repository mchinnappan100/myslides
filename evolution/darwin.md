## 🧬 Darwin's Theory of Evolution

Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionized biology.
It explains how species evolve over generations through inherited traits.

## 👨‍🔬 Who Was Charles Darwin?

* British naturalist (1809–1882)
* Famous for his voyage on the HMS Beagle 🌊
* Published *On the Origin of Species* in 1859 📘
* His work laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology

## 🔍 Core Principles of Evolution

1. **Variation**: Individuals in a population vary in traits.
2. **Inheritance**: Traits are passed from parents to offspring.
3. **Differential Survival**: Some traits help survival and reproduction.
4. **Natural Selection**: Traits that aid survival become more common.

## ⚙️ Mechanisms of Evolution

* **Natural Selection**: Survival of the fittest
* **Mutation**: Random changes in DNA 🧬
* **Gene Flow**: Movement of genes between populations
* **Genetic Drift**: Random changes in allele frequency
* **Sexual Selection**: Traits favored for mating success 💘

## 🦴 Evidence for Evolution

* **Fossils**: Show changes over time (e.g., transitional forms)
* **Comparative Anatomy**: Homologous structures across species
* **Embryology**: Similar development patterns
* **Molecular Biology**: DNA similarities support common ancestry
* **Biogeography**: Species distribution patterns across the globe 🌍

## 🛑 Common Myths Debunked

**“It's just a theory”**
→ Scientific theories are backed by evidence and testing.

**“No transitional fossils”**
→ Many exist: *Tiktaalik*, *Archaeopteryx*, *Australopithecus*.

**“Evolution explains origin of life”**
→ It explains *diversity* of life, not how life began.
