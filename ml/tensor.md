 

## 🧮 Introduction to Tensors

A **tensor** is a mathematical object that generalizes scalars (single numbers), vectors (1D arrays), and matrices (2D arrays) to higher dimensions. Tensors are fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, and machine learning, for representing and manipulating multi-dimensional data.

## 📐 Understanding Tensors

* **Scalar**: 0-dimensional tensor (e.g., a single temperature value).
* **Vector**: 1-dimensional tensor (e.g., wind speed and direction).
* **Matrix**: 2-dimensional tensor (e.g., grayscale image).
* **Higher-order Tensors**: 3D or more (e.g., color images, videos). 

Tensors are characterized by:

* **Rank**: Number of dimensions.
* **Shape**: Size along each dimension.
* **Data Type**: Type of data stored (e.g., float32, int64).

## 🧠 Tensors in Machine Learning

In machine learning and deep learning:

* **Data Representation**: Inputs (images, text), outputs, weights, and biases are all represented as tensors.
* **Operations**: Tensors undergo mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, and convolution.
* **Frameworks**: Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch are built around tensor computations.([medium.com][5])

For example, a color image can be represented as a 3D tensor with dimensions corresponding to height, width, and color channels (red, green, and blue).

## ⚙️ Tensor Operations

Common operations on tensors include:

* **Element-wise Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication.
* **Matrix Multiplication**: Dot product, essential in neural networks.
* **Reshaping**: Changing the shape without altering data.
* **Slicing**: Extracting subsets of data.([deepai.org][4])

These operations are optimized in ML frameworks to run efficiently on hardware like GPUs and TPUs.

## 🌌 Tensors in Physics

Tensors are crucial in physics for describing physical properties that have different values in different directions:

* **Stress Tensor**: Describes internal forces in a material.
* **Electromagnetic Tensor**: Represents electric and magnetic fields.
* **Stress–Energy Tensor**: Describes the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime, central to general relativity 

These tensors transform predictably under coordinate changes, ensuring physical laws remain consistent.
