Here’s the slide deck for **"Attention Is All You Need"** in the same clean markdown format as your Backpropagation example:

## Introduction to “Attention Is All You Need”

“Attention Is All You Need” is a landmark paper by Vaswani et al. (2017) that introduced the Transformer architecture — a model that relies entirely on attention mechanisms, discarding recurrence and convolutions. This enabled faster training and more effective modeling of long-range dependencies.

---

## Motivation Behind the Transformer

* Prior models like RNNs and LSTMs process sequences sequentially, limiting parallelism.
* CNNs improve efficiency but struggle with long-range dependencies.
* The Transformer removes recurrence and uses **attention** to model global dependencies.

---

## Transformer Architecture

The model uses an **encoder-decoder** structure:

* **Encoder**: Processes input sequence
* **Decoder**: Generates output sequence

Each layer includes:

* Multi-head self-attention
* Feed-forward neural network
* Residual connections
* Layer normalization

---

## Self-Attention Mechanism

Self-attention computes relationships between all words in a sequence.

Given Queries (Q), Keys (K), and Values (V):

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √dₖ) V
```

This lets the model focus on relevant parts of the sequence for each word.

---

## Multi-Head Attention

Rather than a single attention function:

* **Multiple attention heads** run in parallel.
* Each head learns different relationships.
* Their outputs are concatenated and projected.

This improves the model’s ability to capture varied patterns.

---

## Positional Encoding

Because attention is **position-agnostic**, we inject positional information using sinusoidal functions:

```
PE(pos, 2i)   = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```

This enables the model to understand the **order** of tokens.

---

## Feed-Forward Networks

Each position in the sequence passes through the same feed-forward network:

```
FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

These layers introduce additional non-linearity and complexity.

---

## Residual Connections & Layer Norm

Each sub-layer (attention, feed-forward) is wrapped with:

```
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))
```

This aids **training stability** and **gradient flow**, allowing deeper networks.

---

## Decoder: Masked Attention & Output Generation

* The **decoder** uses masked self-attention to prevent looking ahead.
* It also attends to encoder outputs for context.
* Output is generated **step-by-step**, token-by-token.

---

## Training & Results

* Evaluated on machine translation tasks:

  * **English→French**: 41.8 BLEU
  * **English→German**: 28.4 BLEU
* Outperforms LSTMs with fewer compute resources and faster training.

---

## Advantages of the Transformer

* **Parallelizable**: Processes sequences in parallel.
* **Scalable**: Effective with large data and deep architectures.
* **Generalizable**: Forms the backbone of models like BERT, GPT, T5, etc.

---

## Limitations and Challenges

* **Quadratic time complexity** with respect to sequence length.
* **Lack of recurrence** means it may not always capture fine-grained temporal patterns.
* Subsequent work addresses these with **sparse attention** and **efficient transformers**.
