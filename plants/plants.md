## 🌱 What Are Plants?

* Multicellular, photosynthetic organisms
* Belong to the kingdom **Plantae**
* Use **sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water** to produce energy
* Provide oxygen, food, and shelter for life on Earth

## 🌳 Major Types of Plants

1. **Bryophytes**

   * Small, non-vascular
   * Live in moist environments
   * Example: Mosses

2. **Pteridophytes**

   * Have vascular tissues
   * Reproduce with spores
   * Example: Ferns

3. **Gymnosperms**

   * Produce seeds without flowers
   * Typically cone-bearing
   * Example: Pine trees

4. **Angiosperms**

   * Flowering plants with seeds inside fruits
   * Most diverse group of plants

---

## 🌲 Gymnosperms

* Ancient seed-producing plants
* No flowers or fruits
* Reproduce using cones
* Common in cold and dry environments
* Examples include pine, fir, spruce, and ginkgo

---

## 🌸 Angiosperms

* Also known as **flowering plants**
* Seeds are enclosed in fruits
* Include trees, herbs, shrubs, grasses
* Support complex ecosystems with pollinators
* Examples: Rose, sunflower, wheat, mango

---

## 🌎 Plants Across Ecosystems

* **Rainforests**: Home to orchids, ferns, towering trees
* **Deserts**: Resilient plants like cacti and succulents
* **Grasslands**: Dominated by wild grasses and seasonal flowers
* **Tundras**: Cold-adapted mosses and lichens
* **Wetlands**: Water-loving plants like reeds and lotus

## 🌾 Plants in Agriculture

* Humans cultivate plants for food, fiber, fuel
* Common crops include:

## 🌳 Amazing Plant Superpowers

* **Sequoia trees**: tallest and largest living organisms
* **Duckweed**: tiniest flowering plant
* **Mimosa pudica**: folds when touched
* **Venus flytrap**: catches insects
* Some communicate through chemical signals!

---

## 🚨 Endangered Plants

* Many plant species are at risk due to:

  * Habitat loss
  * Climate change
  * Pollution
* Rare plants like:

  * Baobabs
  * Rafflesia (world’s largest flower)
  * Wild orchids
* Conservation efforts are vital

---

## 🌍 Why Plants Matter

* Clean the air we breathe
* Support all food chains
* Maintain climate balance
* Provide medicine, materials, inspiration

---

## 🌱 Final Thoughts

* Plants are **life-givers**
* They are ancient, diverse, and essential
